# Mapty

## Introduction

This project is a fitness app created as a practice exercise for utilizing JavaScript ES6 classes, DOM manipulation, as well as libraries and API.

It includes the following functionalities: choosing workout types (running and cycling), calculating workout statistics, and displaying workout locations on a map. The map display function is built using the Leaflet library. In addition, data is saved on page reload. Data is preserved by using localStorage.
